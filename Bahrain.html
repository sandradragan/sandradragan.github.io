    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>In 1783, the Sunni Al-Khalifa family took power in Bahrain.
        In order to secure these holdings, it entered into a series of treaties
        with the UK during the 19th century that made Bahrain a British protectorate. </p>

      <p>The archipelago attained its independence in 1971. A steady decline in oil production and
        reserves since 1970 prompted Bahrain to take steps to diversify its economy,
        in the process developing petroleum processing and refining, aluminum production, and hospitality and retail sectors.</p>

      <p>It has also endeavored to become a leading regional banking center, especially with respect to Islamic finance. Bahrain's small size,
        central location among Gulf countries, economic dependence on Saudi Arabia,
        and proximity to Iran require it to play a delicate balancing act in foreign affairs among its larger neighbors.<p>

      <p>Its foreign policy activities usually fall in line with Saudi Arabia and the UAE.</p>

      <p> The Sunni royal family has long struggled to manage relations with its large Shia-majority population.
        In early 2011, amid Arab uprisings elsewhere in the region, the Bahraini Government confronted similar pro-democracy
        and reform protests at home with police and military action, including deploying Gulf Cooperation Council security forces to Bahrain.</p>

      <p>Failed political talks prompted opposition political societies to boycott
          2014 legislative and municipal council elections.</p>

      <p>In 2018, a law preventing members of political societies dissolved by the courts
        from participating in elections effectively sidelined the majority of
        opposition figures from taking part in national elections.</p>

      <p>As a result, most members of parliament are independents.
        Ongoing dissatisfaction with the political status quo continues to factor
        into sporadic clashes between demonstrators and security forces.</p>

        <p>On 15 September 2020, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates signed peace agreements
          (the Abraham Accords) with Israel – brokered by the US – in Washington DC.</p>

        <p>Bahrain and the UAE thus became the third and fourth Middle Eastern countries,
          along with Egypt and Jordan, to recognize Israel.</p>
